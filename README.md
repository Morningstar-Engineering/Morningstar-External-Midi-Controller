# Morningstar-External-Midi-Controller
Simple Arduino-based Midi Controller to control your Morningstar MC6

With the MC6 v2.2 update, the MC6 can now be controlled with PC and CC messages. These messages will allow you to Bank up/down, call presets or jump banks on the MC6. All you need is a simple external Midi Controller and you are good to go.

The code here is written for an 8 switch controller. We used a Arduino Micro for this, since there is already an onboard 5v regulator which will minimize the number of parts needed.
